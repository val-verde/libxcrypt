### Disabled policies

# Version strings were only problematic in versions of Perl older than
# our minimum.
[-ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitVersionStrings]

# The rationale for prohibiting boolean 'grep' is sensible
# (it doesn't short-circuit, which could be a huge waste of time)
# but the recommended alternative is 'any' from List::MoreUtils,
# which would be the only CPAN dependency we had.
[-BuiltinFunctions::ProhibitBooleanGrep]

# The "complex" subroutines and regexes are not that bad and splitting
# them up would only obscure the logic.

# I can't find any explanation of what qualifies as "brief" and the
# diagnostic triggers on perfectly sensible code.

# I'd *like* to disable this *only* for $_, where the whole point is
# that it gets written to (and read from) implicitly, but that's not
# possible.

# of consumers.

# currently has non-ASCII characters in it.

# Doesn't understand the unusual, but unavoidable, uses of -f in this code
# (to identify executables without actually running them).
[-ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitFiletest_f]

# There is no option to ignore use of just one module
